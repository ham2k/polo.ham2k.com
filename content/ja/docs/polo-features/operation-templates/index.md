We tend to keep doing the same sorts of portable operations/activities. PoLo will recognise the pattern and offer a template for your next new Operation base on prior behaviour. The templates in the offering below show the most popular operations. Selecting one will save a few taps when creating a new one.

Tapping on the first template above, will create an operation for VK1AO and add a single POTA park and a single WWFF park. Assuming a GPS location has been obtained or set, both these added parks will be populated from the offline parks list. The parks added will be selected from the parks nearest to the currently set location.

Sometimes the park location and your location does not reflect the exact park you are in but this can easily be changed. Often, however, the selection is done for you and saves a few more taps and keying to set the operation up.

If you popularly operate as 2 or 3 operators in a group, the template will show the callsigns of all the operators and save keying them in to begin.
