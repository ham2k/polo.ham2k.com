## What do the emojis mean?

<p>Every now and then you will see an emoji within the Callsign Info Panel, for example if you enter KI2D you'll get the following: 🤩 Sebastián - Ham2K PoLo Creator.</p> 

You can expect to see any of the following, and some others too:<br>
🧑‍💻 - Ham2K PoLo contributor<br>
👷 - Ham2K Test Crew<br>
📺 - YouTuber<br>
💻 - Software developer<br><br>

In addition it's possible to add your own list of callsigns with details (and emojis) using the Settings > Data Sttings > Custom Callsign Notes option. You can link to your offsite list which could include POTA friends, fellow club members etc.
