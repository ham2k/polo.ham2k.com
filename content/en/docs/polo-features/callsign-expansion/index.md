description: Using Callsign Notes file for multi-callsign expansion
---
The [Callsign Notes](../callsign-notes/) file can be used to store and retrieve multiple callsign lists from a shortcut stored in the file.

### Callsign Shortcuts/Abbreviations
A typical Callsign Notes file entry will look like this:
```
VK1AO Alan
VK4KC Marty
KI2D Sebasti√°n
# etc
```
For each callsign entered, the accompanying name will be displayed as a note, but the callsign will be in the "Their Call" ready for sending (saving).

When an entry is made with 2 leading dots (or slashes) and the note file entry is formatted with a comma separated list instead of a single name entry, the list of callsigns are expanded and entered into the "Their Call" entry field ready for confirmation and saving.
```
1AO VK1AO,VK2MET
4KC VK4KC,VK4MAD,VK4DOG
1RF VK1RF,VK2MK, VK4CEE
# etc
```
So by entering ..1RF or //1RF the prompt becomes:

The first tap of the send button will drop the expanded list into "Their Call" where you may edit, add or remove a callsign to confirm.
The second tap of the send button will submit the list of callsigns into your operation as separate QSOs.
