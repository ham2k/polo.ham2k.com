Everyone will have their favourite way to handle a pileup. For those who like the callsign fragment method i.e. one where you might scribble down callsign fragments and then back track to each fragment in the list one at a time, then Callsign Stacking may be of interest.

In the "Their Call" entry field, enter each fragment that is heard separated by double slashes or two dots which will be converted to slashes.

Then work backwards through the stack, correcting each call until confirmed. Once confirmed, send the corrected call to your log.

Sending a complete call will remove it from the stack and leave the stack ready for correcting the next partial/fragment.

Continue until all fragments are corrected and submittted.

#### Stacking expansions

It's also possible to stack callsign partials which are actually expansions. Just add the expansion into the stack and add another 2 dots or slashes. You can choose to expand this partial right away, or you can continue adding partials. Once all your partials are added, you can work your way back throught the stack. You will be prompted to expand the expansion partials and send the expanded list to your log, then continue on with the rest of the stack.
