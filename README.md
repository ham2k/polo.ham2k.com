# Ham2K PoLo Docs

This is the source code for the Ham2K Portable Logger Documentation. You can visit the site at [https://polo.ham2k.com](https://polo.ham2k.com).

# Contributing to these docs

This site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) theme, and hosted on AWS Amplify.

You can contribute to the documentation by submitting a pull request to this repository.

For Docsy documentation, see [Docsy user guide](https://docsy.dev/docs).

If you want to do SCSS edits and want to publish these, you need to install `PostCSS`

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the website locally

Building and running the site locally requires a recent `extended` version of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).
You can find out more about how to install Hugo for your environment in our
[Getting started](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/getting-started/#prerequisites-and-installation) guide.

Once you've made your working copy of the site repo, from the repo root folder, run:

```bash
npm run serve
```

## Troubleshooting

As you run the website locally, you may run into the following error:

```console
$ hugo server
WARN 2023/06/27 16:59:06 Module "project" is not compatible with this Hugo version; run "hugo mod graph" for more information.
Start building sites …
hugo v0.101.0-466fa43c16709b4483689930a4f9ac8add5c9f66+extended windows/amd64 BuildDate=2022-06-16T07:09:16Z VendorInfo=gohugoio
Error: Error building site: "C:\Users\foo\path\to\docsy-example\content\en\_index.md:5:1": failed to extract shortcode: template for shortcode "blocks/cover" not found
Built in 27 ms
```

This error occurs if you are running an outdated version of Hugo. As of docsy theme version `v0.7.0`, hugo version `0.110.0` or higher is required.
See this [section](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/get-started/docsy-as-module/installation-prerequisites/#install-hugo) of the user guide for instructions on how to install Hugo.

Or you may be confronted with the following error:

```console
$ hugo server

```

This error occurs if you have not installed the extended version of Hugo.
See this [section](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/get-started/docsy-as-module/installation-prerequisites/#install-hugo) of the user guide for instructions on how to install Hugo.

Or you may encounter the following error:

```console
$ hugo server

Error: failed to download modules: binary with name "go" not found
```

This error occurs if you have not installed the `go` programming language on your system.
See this [section](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/get-started/docsy-as-module/installation-prerequisites/#install-go-language) of the user guide for instructions on how to install `go`.
