## Shortcut Polo Features

All frequency bands and modes that PoLo supports are made available for use from Settings > Logging Settings > Bands & Modes. Initially the common bands and modes are available, this can be changed to all bands, and all modes by tapping 'Show all bands' or 'Show more modes' at the bottom of each section.

Once you have access to the band or mode you're searching for enable it by using its switch. Backing out of that page to the Logging Settings page will show you the bands and modes available to be used in a new operation.
