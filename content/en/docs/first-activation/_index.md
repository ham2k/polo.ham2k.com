  Get started using PoLo and log your first contacts.
---

PoLo will launch into the initial screen which will request basic information to polulate the log, there's an option to skip this in which case the information will have to be entered manually.

Once your callsign, and activities that you interested in (such as POTA, SOTA, WWFF) you'll be presented with a Data Privacy screen with a couple of switches to enable or disable the sharing of data.

Completion of that will enable the app to pause briefly at the splash screen in order to download data that it needs to operate; checking for app updates, download POTA, SOTA, and WWFF data if you enabled them in the previous steps. And with that, PoLo is running.

You do not have to do anything more, just hit the +New Operation button, do some log configuration and then get on the air!

When you press that +New Operation button you'll be presented with the option to add an activity, and when you've completed that back out to the operation window where you'll see four tabs; QSOs, Spots, Map, and operation.

The operation, and map tabs are self explanatory, the spots tab connected to the spotting service associated with your activity so that you're able to find the current activators. The QSOs tab needs your frequency, band and mode of operation entering but once that's done you're ready to start logging contacts.
