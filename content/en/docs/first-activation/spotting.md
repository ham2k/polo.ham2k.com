Access to the information entry a spot point is from the QSSO page and the Spotting button.

* Give it a good name, ending in `.md` - e.g. `getting-started.md`
* Edit the "front matter" section at the top of the page (weight controls how its ordered amongst other pages in the same directory; lowest number first).
* Add a good commit message at the bottom of the page (<80 characters; use the extended description field for more detail).
* Create a new branch so you can preview your new file and request a review via Pull Request.
