PoLo is currently supports the following "On The Air" types of operations. More will be added over time and if you have a request please ask on the Discord Server.

A single operation can involve multiple activities and PoLo will provide all the fields required to log the contacts for each activity, as well as generate separate ADIF and Cabrillo files as needed.

### POTA - Parks On The Air

PoLo can be used to activate multiple parks and will generate a separate ADIF file for each park reference.
