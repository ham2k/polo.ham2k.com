In the meantime, some users have reported success running PoLo on Windows using Android emulators like [BlueStacks](https://www.bluestacks.com/).

### Mac OS

The iPad version of PoLo can be installed on Macs with Apple Silicon (M1 processors and newer) using the same [AppStore link above](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ham2k-portable-logger/id6478713938).

A version for older Macs with Intel processors might be available in the future.
