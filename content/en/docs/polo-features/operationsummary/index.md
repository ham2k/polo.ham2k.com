PoLo opens on the Operations Summary page. A list of your operations are presented to you with your callsign, activity code/ID number, the name of the location, the number of QSOs in the activity so far and the date of the operation. The number of QSOs shown top right of the Operation band is the number of QSOs not including any QSOs marked as deleted.

At the bottom of the Operations Summary is a Quick Call Lookup and Spots link.

### Quick Callsign Lookup
Enter a callsign in the lookup area and the lookup data will display including any Callsign Notes you have present for the callsign.
Tap the panel to open the full QRZ callsign lookup.

### Spots
Tap the hamburger icon to open the Spots page. This can be handy for checking spots when not in a specific operation. Unlike the action available during an operation, tapping a spot on this view will not enter the details to start logging a QSO. You need to be in an operation for this action to apply.

### Opening an Operation
Tap on an operation band to open the Operation for editing. See [Operations/QSO List Panel](../operations/) for information on entering QSOs.
