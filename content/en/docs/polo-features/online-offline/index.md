## Online and Offline

<p>During an operation PoLo only needs an Internet connection to enable spotting, and to pull contact data from qrz.com, all other data is stored on your device.</p>

<p>These offline data files, those within the Settings > Offline Data area along with those in Settings Callsign Notes synchronise periodically dependant on how often they might change. Callsign Notes update daily; the well established programmes such as SOTA update every 3 months or so, but POTA and WWFF are set to update monthly due to their possibilty of expanding as more sites are included within those programmes.</p>

<p>Each of these data sets can be refreshed manually by selecting them in the Data Settings area, and tapping Refresh on the pop-up.</p>
